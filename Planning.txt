I can accept orders - assuming no sandwich type, assuming asap timing
I can present a list of orders


2 1/2 mins to make a sandwich
1 min to serve and take payment
Take a break when no orders to make or serve

3 time slots
each time slot needs:
sequence number - can just be the index in the list
time 
task - can track using class type or global
recipient




Time-Slot class:
attributes - sequence number, start time, #task

Child classes:
Make - start time, end time, duration = 2.5, recipient
Serve - start time, end time, duration = 1, recipient
Break - start time, duration - infinite (assuming will always be at the end of the schedule)

Store all time slot instances in an ordered list


Constantly update output, as soon as an order comes in - gui has entry and button for giving an order, with window for displaying orders on the side



offset time from start - not real time
